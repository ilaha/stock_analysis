# Green Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

- In this project, we aimed to help Steve to analyse the value of stocks, expecially, how actively DQ was traded back in 2018, as his parents wanted to invest in it. IF we were able to sum up the faily volume of for DQ, then we could have an approximate idea on how often it gets traded to see if it was worth to invest in or not. 

- By using for loops, we could calculate the daily volume in 2018, where we wrote a code that looped through the  beginning and ending of the column to see the sum/total volume for 2018. 

- As Steve wanted to figure out how DQ performed in 2018, we needed to find the yearly return for the whole year, to see if the yearly return is in percentage increase or decrease from the beginning to the end of the year of 2018. 


## Results
 
- As a result, while the results showed that DQ traded 107, 873,900 shared in 2018, we noticed that Daqo dropped over 63% (62.6 % to be precise) in 2018. Which was clear that AQ is not the best option to invest in. That's why we did perform our analysis by looping through all the stocks and analysing the total volume and return for both 2017 and 2018 year.

## Summary

 - As a summary, we realized that when we rector the previously written code and work on it, it saves us time and we were able to loop through both 2017 and 2018 stock data to analise the volume and return to decide the best ticker to invest in. 

- While 2017 data showed that AQ was one  of the best options to invest, 2018 data changed that and the families best options are ENPH and Run based on the 2018 analysis. Considering Run's 2017 returns were only 5.5 %, my personal recommendation to Steve to advise his parents would be proceeding with investing in ENPH.
